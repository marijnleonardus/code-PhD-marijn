# code-PhD-marijn

Scripts for calculations, plots and data analysis of my research. 

* Scripts have been tested in a conda environment (version 25.3.1) with python version 3.9.21.
* The working directory should be set to the root folder `code-PhD-marijn` for the imports to work. 
* Plots will be saved under `output` folder. 
* `Modules` and `utils` folders contain functions/classes that are imported in the individual `scripts`. To do this, run in root folder the following:

`pip install -e .` 

This allows python to find the modules and utils contents
