# code-PhD-marijn

Scripts for calculations, plots and data analysis of my research. 
Scripts have been tested in a conda environment with default settings. 

The working directory should be set to the parent folder `code-PhD-marijn` for the imports to work.

Plots will be saved under `output` folder. 

`Modules` folder contains functions/classes that are imported in the individual `scripts`
